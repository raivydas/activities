Data science project

The aim of the project is to manipulate the wearable device experiment data (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). The experiment, the datasets, and the variables are explained in the file CodeBook.md. There is only one file run_analysis.R with the script performing the manipulations. The explanantion of the code is given in the comments in this file. The resulting tidy datasets are written into tidydataset.txt and tidybyactivitysubject.txt.

In order to run the script run_analysis.R, the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip has to be stored in the UCI HAR Dataset folder in the same directory as the script file.
